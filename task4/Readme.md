# CodeCanvas: AI-Powered Architectural Pattern Explorer & Migrator

## Problem Statement

Modern software engineering teams face significant challenges with technical debt and architectural stagnation. The inertia of existing architectural patterns creates a major barrier to evolution. Developers inheriting large, monolithic codebases or outdated patterns face:

- **Manual, error-prone analysis** of complex codebases
- **High expertise requirements** for architectural refactoring
- **Significant business risk** during migration projects
- **Lack of clear visualization** of current and target states

## Solution

CodeCanvas is an AI-driven tool that intelligently analyzes, visualizes, and facilitates architectural pattern migration. It transforms architectural evolution from a daunting, expert-only task into a manageable, data-driven process.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Intelligent Pattern Recognition
- **AST-based Analysis**: Deep code analysis using Abstract Syntax Trees
- **ML-Powered Classification**: Graph Neural Networks to identify current architectural patterns
- **Dependency Mapping**: Comprehensive understanding of class relationships and data flow

### 📊 Interactive Visualization
- **Real-time Architecture Graph**: Navigable visualization of current code structure
- **Complexity Hotspots**: Identify areas of tight coupling and broken boundaries
- **Pattern Violation Detection**: Highlight deviations from architectural principles

### 🔄 Pattern Migration Simulation
- **"What-if" Analysis**: Simulate migrations to target patterns (Microservices, Clean Architecture, Event-Driven, etc.)
- **Service Boundary Proposals**: AI-clustered service recommendations
- **Domain-Driven Design Support**: Aggregate identification and boundary context mapping

### 🛠️ Refactoring Automation
- **Phased Migration Plans**: Actionable, step-by-step refactoring roadmap
- **Code Scaffolding Generation**: Boilerplate code for new services and components
- **Continuous Validation**: Real-time pattern adherence checking during refactoring

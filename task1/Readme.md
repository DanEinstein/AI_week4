# Comparison docs
This documentation explores at the different versions that i have built. One of the versions is written by AI and the other version is written by me.
The AI.py file contains the code from AI and the app.py contains the code that i have written.
In both of them we are looking at the sort() method and sorted() function and how they are used.
Comparing the two codes both of them serve the same purpose but the code written by AI is well commented more than i have done myself.
The AI code tends to be more efficient as it uses reusable function while the other code does not use reusable functions.
This is an advantage as there is huge repetition which is one of the factors that make a code more inefficient as it takes more time to execute.
In conclusion the AI code is more efficient in terms of handling the computer memory while my code is easy to read for a new person.
